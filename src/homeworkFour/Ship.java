/*
Build a Ship. Every ship must have length, width, name, year, price and motorboat.
It can move fast in sea, move slow, and park on the coast.
Motorboat is a separate object.
Every motorboat must have year and price, and 2 actions - leaveShip and getInShip.

Create constructors with all the fields of the two objects.
Create 2 Ships with their motorboats.
Make the motorboats leave and get in ship. Make the ships run fast, after that run slow and finally park.
